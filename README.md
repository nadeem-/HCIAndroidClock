###### Description: A class project for CMSC434: Human-Computer Interaction. The task was to create a custom clock for Android.  
###### View the demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-mQCWgxB20&feature=youtu.be  

###### Installation:
To run our app, you need you need the following installed:
	Java 1.7 (we use jdk1.7.0_67.jdk)
	API 18: Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) (Compile SDK Version)

	Android Virtual device:
		We used the default Nexus 4 emulator

You may have to change your SDK location as it is likely to differ from our Android Studio environment.
	To do that, go to File -> Project Structure -> SDK Location -> 
		Enter your Android SDK path in the box for "Android SDK location:"
		Ex: "/Applications/android-sdk"

To start the app, open the project in Android Studio and 
click the Run button.

###### Tutorial/Features:
You will see the basic clock when the app first launches. 

To adjust settings, click the settings menu icon (3 dots) and tap "Settings".
	* Here you can change basic configurations such as time format and text color.
	* Toggle the display weather info switch and enter your ZIP code to get local weather info.

To switch clocks, tap "Switch Clock" in the settings menu.

###### Custom Clock:

You can click the settings menu to set random colors or use custom colors for the animation.

When you tap "Set Custom Colors" you are sent to a color picker to set colors.

	Tap on Color 1 and then tap any color to set a primary color.
	Tap on Color 2 and then tap any color to set a secondary color.
	Tap "Select Colors" when you are finished.
